    <p>
      This brain game is programmed by Fred Bolder. The free version has 10 levels and 2 trainings levels.
      In every level you control the blue ball with the happy face. You have to eat all the little green balls. In the
      first levels this is very easy, but later it becomes so difficult, that you think it is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Bal works good on your computer, you can buy it for only 5 euro to have access to much more levels (63 in
      total) and to be able to use macros. If there is a new version of Bal available with even more levels, registered
      users will be notified and there will be no additional costs for the new levels.
